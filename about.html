 <!---- About ------->
        
        <section class="about">
            <h2>Are you a shop?</h2>
            <p>Yes Mike's Rifts is a fully licensed aquatic trader and a registered business that sells to the public.
We are rated at the level of 5 stars by St. Helens Environmental Health Department & DEFRA.
This means we operate at the highest level achievable with regards to the welfare and husbandry standards of our livestock.</p>
            
            <h2>Why are you appointment only?</h2>
            <p>Our business premises are based at home therefore visits need to be pre-arranged. <br /> Visits can be arranged via telephone, email or facebook.</p>
            
            <h2>What times are suitable for an appointment?</h2>
            <p>Weekdays we are available normal business hours as well as weekends. Evening visits can also be arranged.</p>
            
            <h2>If I can't make an appointment what happens?</h2>
            <p>If for whatever reason you cannot make an appointment just let us know. <br />We can re-arrange your appointment and then open up your original slot for another customer.</p>
            
            <h2>If I can't visit how do I order fish from you?</h2>
            <p>You can telephone, email or facebook message us to make a stock enquiry. <br />Once you have finalised your order you can pay via banking/app transfer or payment over the phone using your debit card.</p>
            
            <h2>Where do you get your Tanganyikan & Malawi Cichlids from?</h2>
            <p>Most of our wild caught Tanganyikan & Malawi Cichlids are imported directly from east Africa. <br />Our tank bred stocks are sourced from suppliers who offer the best quality rather than the best price.</p>
            
            <h2>I've heard there are companies in Africa breeding Tanganyikan & Malawi Cichlids in ponds?</h2>
            <p>There was a company based in Burundi who bred mostly Tanganyikan cichlids in ponds (now defunct).<br /> Apart from some very small scale breeding for endangered species it's a myth that wild caught fish are pond bred. <br />It's been tried by several people in the past but has failed as running fish farms for aquaculture in the countries in the rift lake region has proven extremely problematic.</p>
            
            <h2>Who is this Mike character?</h2>
            <p>Mike's Rifts was set-up in 2009 after a redundancy notice offered me an opportunity to change careers. <br />I've been keeping Malawi & Tanganyikan cichlids since 1984 and this hobby has enabled me to visit both Lake Malawi and Lake Tanganyika. <br />My life long passion for these animals is what continues to drive Mike's Rifts.</p>
